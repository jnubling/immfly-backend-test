# immfly-backend-test
Media platform API backend test.

I'm attending to an online course of advanced REST API backend development at London App Development School that really helped me on doing this project and also another course of Test Driven Development that I've just started and that also help me with some simple test development I'm not yet very familiarized with.

I've started the project by creating a GitHub project defining its dependencies and requirements, as well as a DockerFile, DockerIgnore and the main folder "app" of the project.

All the tests, linting, and folders created was made/run on the terminal with the command defined on the docker-compose.yml file, this was tought on the very first classes of the course I'm attending.

I've tried to develop a "checks.yml" file at github/workflows to help me automate my tests and lintings with the GitHub Actions, but for some reason I do not know yet why it's not working.

The management rating command took me a bit of time to get it done and once I've got it, I found myself stucked at the development of its unit test. Although I'm not very convinced that it is working properly.

The course of REST API has many topics related with the development of this project, and many of these topics are yet relatively new to me: I.e. The concepts of serializers and views, filtering with tags/groups and the application deployment.
Unfortunatly there was not enough time for me to attend for theses classes before the deadline of this test, although I can figure out they will be very useful.
